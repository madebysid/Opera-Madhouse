==============

A simple JavaScript Game made for Cordova


Changelog:
1. Added basic maain menu.
2. Fully randomized obstacles
3. Added basic scoring based on time

Bugs:
1. If you stay on the top left, you will never lose
2. Collision still erratic. Problem in collisionCheck() function conditions, most probably
3. Obstacles going back down are visible. Should disappear, then reappear on the bottom

To Do:
1. Splash Screen
2. Maintain a local high score (JavaScript cookies! Yum!)
3. Build leaderboard
4. Graphics

Comments:
Ugly as fuck. The developer doesn't want to play this right now. -_-
